                                    <p> Points Rummy is the fastest form of Rummy - each game lasts for one deal only. After
                                        each game, the winner gets the chips from the other players depending on the count
                                        and point value. Not only do these games require a high level of skill but also
                                        generate tremendous excitement.
                                        Players can play and win a high number of games in a short span of time.
